# Welcome to Readdit!

Readdit is a lightweight and easy to use Reddit-reader app made using React and Redux. Perfect for mindlessly scrolling through Reddit and lurking on your favourite subreddits.

## Features:

* Generate a newsfeed based upon your subreddit of choice (defaults to r/popular).
* View comments for individual posts (by clicking a post title or post blurb).
* Easily view individual subreddits by clicking on them wherever they appear.
* Search bar in which you can search for posts/subreddits and more.
* Favorites list - add subreddits to a favorites list with the click of a button to enable viewing later!

## Upcoming Features:

Below is a list of features to be added (when I get a chance!):
* Light-mode (and the ability to switch between light and dark).
* See posts/comments by a user by clicking their name.
* Displaying images/gifs in comments.
* Displaying posts that contain a gallery of images.

## How to use:

This app is hosted on netlify at the following link: 

Alternatively, please feel free to download the code and host it locally. Please follow the instructions below to do so.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
